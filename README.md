This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

# Description

This project, built using Angular, consists of two modules: Admin and Student.The Admin module is responsible for performing various operations such as creating, updating, and deleting exams, as well as managing exam-related information. The Admin can also manage student information, including adding, updating, and deleting student records, along with their report cards. Additionally, the Admin can generate reports for individual students as well as consolidated reports for all students, organized by exam.

The Student module allows students to log in using their student ID and password, which are provided by the Admin. Once logged in, students can access the exams assigned to them and take the exams. After completing an exam, the student's report card will be displayed.

This project has been developed using Angular, a popular TypeScript-based web application framework. Angular provides a robust and scalable platform for building dynamic and responsive web applications. Its modular architecture, powerful features, and extensive ecosystem make it an ideal choice for developing complex applications like this one.

The project leverages Angular's component-based structure, routing capabilities, and data binding features to create a seamless user experience. It incorporates Angular's reactive forms for handling user input and validation. Additionally, the project utilizes Angular's HTTP module to communicate with the backend API for retrieving and updating data.

With its clean and maintainable codebase, extensive documentation, and intuitive user interface, this Angular-based project provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing exams and student information in an educational setting.
